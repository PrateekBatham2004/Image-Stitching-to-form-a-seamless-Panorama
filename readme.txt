ðŸ§µ Image Stitching Panorama Project
This project demonstrates how to generate a seamless panorama from multiple images using SIFT feature detection, keypoint matching, and homography transformation.

Originally developed and tested on Google Colab, it has been converted into a local Python script-based GitHub-uploadable folder.

ðŸ“Œ Project Features
1. Image Preparation & Visualization

>Load image pairs.
>Convert to RGB and grayscale.
>Visualize input image pairs side-by-side.

2. SIFT Keypoint Detection

>Detect keypoints and compute descriptors using cv2.SIFT_create().
>Visualize detected keypoints on grayscale images.

3. Keypoint Matching
>>Match descriptors using:
  >Brute-Force Matching with cv2.BFMatcher and cross-check.
  >KNN Matching with Loweâ€™s ratio test.

4. Homography Estimation

>Use matched keypoints to compute a homography matrix with RANSAC.
>Transform one image onto the plane of the other using cv2.warpPerspective.

5. Panorama Stitching

>Combine warped images with original inputs to create a wide-angle panorama.
>Fallback to cv2.Stitcher_create() if feature matching fails.
